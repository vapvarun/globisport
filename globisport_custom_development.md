# GlobiSport Custom Development Requirements

## üéØ Overview

While the GlobiSport platform leverages existing WordPress plugins extensively, certain sport-specific requirements and user experience enhancements require custom development. This document outlines what needs to be built custom and the technical approaches for implementation.

## üèóÔ∏è Critical Custom Development Areas

### 1. Sports-Specific Profile Field System

**What Needs Custom Development:**
- Dynamic profile fields based on user roles (Athlete, Coach, Organization, Fan)
- Conditional field display logic
- Sport-specific validation rules
- Profile completion calculation algorithm

**Why Standard Plugins Fall Short:**
- PeepSo's profile fields are static and don't change based on user roles
- No built-in conditional logic for field display
- Standard validation doesn't cover sport-specific requirements (e.g., position validation per sport)

**Technical Implementation Approach:**

**Core Components:**
- PHP Classes: Profile Field Manager, Sport Validator, Conditional Display Logic, Profile Completeness Calculator
- JavaScript: Conditional field display, sport/position autocomplete, progress tracking
- Database: Custom meta fields for sport data, lookup tables for sports/positions, validation rules

**Development Estimate: 40-50 hours (1-1.25 weeks)**
- Planning & Analysis: 4 hours
- Backend Development: 24 hours
- Frontend JavaScript: 12 hours
- Database Design: 6 hours
